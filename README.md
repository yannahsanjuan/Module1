## Description

My motivation for this project is to fully satisfy, if not exceed, the client's criteria in a web application. I built this project to enhance my skills as a web developer. It allowed me to have an introduction to what I may experience in a professional setting as a web developer working with actual clients. It solves the criteria of the client which is to refactore the starter code and giving it more accessibility for all users. It also utilizes semantic HTML tags that contain comments for each tag. I learned that learning the client's acceptance criteria will help become a more effective developer. Having an organized and accesible HTML document is also convenient for both the developer and the client.
